# data-structures
While taking a DS course at my university (UNIST), I implemented major data structures as part of my course assignments. Those data structures, which I built from scratch, range from simple ones like linked list to more advanced types such as balanced binary search trees, and also come with additional functionality. 

Each assignment folder contains a project description file (README.pdf). Please read it before looking at the code to get an idea about the assignment as a whole.
